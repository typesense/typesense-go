        Create or update a collection alias. An alias is a virtual collection name that points
        to a real collection. If you're familiar with symbolic links on Linux, it's very similar
        to that. Aliases are useful when you want to reindex your data in the
        background on a new collection and switch your application to it without any changes to
        your code.
